        <h3 style="color: rgb(27, 6, 121);">------- Technical Interview -------</h3>
    <b> What is a technical interview?</b>

         A technical interview is a pre-qualification screening for a job, usually
      in IT, that is highly technical in nature.These interviews can be time-
      consuming as they may contain multiple parts, including things like 
      remote screening and coding challenges. The elements of a technical 
      interview may seem intimidating,but upon closer examination, they are 
      designed to test your critical thinking and real-world problem-solving 
      skills in several situations where they may come into play while on job.

     <b> A technical interview usually has three common parts: </b>

       <b>1) Phone screen </b>
           During a phone screen, a qualifying interviewer determines whether 
           you're a good fit for the position by asking you questions & review 
           your answers over the phone.
 
     <b>  2) Remote Coding Assignment </b>
           You may be asked to provide a remote coding assignment to secure
           the in-person interview. For example, if you're working for a financial
           company that builds applications for people who need to build their 
           credit in Python, you may be tested on your ability to use Python to
           build a user interface.

      <b> 3) In-person interview </b>
           After you've had a phone screen and done your homework, your 
           next interview step might be to come in and sit down with interview
           to confirm your candidacy. During the in-person interview, you'll be asked behavioral and technical questions and have
           the opportunity to bring up questions of your own.

            <b style="color: rgb(249, 40, 17);">   Based on the needs of the interviewer, there may be multiple in-person interviews, or
             if it's for a remote position, none at all. However, the above interview framework 
             provides a strong basis for setting expectations for a technical interview. During
             a technical interview, you should strive to display the following qualities: </b>
            
            <b>  # Technical knowledge and analytical skills </b>
             Expert-level knowledge of coding and the technical job requirements are necessary to
             succeed in the role as well as the ability to analyze your work and create new strategies
             based upon your analysis.

           <b>   # Advanced problem-solving </b>
             Technical professionals are often asked to solve complex problems and your ability to do
             that is essential in a technical interview.

           <b>   # Creativity and innovation </b>
             Companies use foundational technology to grow and be more competitive in their market, so
             bringing on a creative person who can come up with several solutions to a single problem is
             important to overall growth strategy.

          <b>    # Communication </b>
             How well you communicate with others could be a factor in getting the job. Some technical
             roles are responsible for explaining complicated processes to people in a way that is simple
             to understand. In others, you may need to be able to work as a part of a team. In these cases,
             communicating through issues is key.

          <b>    # Cultural fit </b>
             Candidates should do due diligence to learn about the company culture and tie their skills to
             corporate values.

            <b> # How to prep for a tech interview</b>
                 To prepare for your next technical interview, make sure to:
                1.The tools and skills necessary for the role.
                2.Study helpful books and digital publications.
                3.Practice for the interview.
                4.Be a conversationalist and prepare to ask questions.
                5.Take the time you need. 

            <b  style="color: rgb(5, 95, 5);"> 1. <u>Consider the tools and skills necessary for the role.</u> </b>
                      Think about the basic requirements of the job. Reviewing the job description to determine what
                    you need to study is fundamental. This may include things like working with data structures, 
                    coding in a specific language or using business intelligence tools.
                    A strong understanding of the basics will put you in a good position to answer any applicable
                    interview questions. You can create an outline of what you need to study or refresh your knowledge
                    by focusing on the basic principles required for the technical role.

            <b  style="color: rgb(5, 95, 5);">  2. <u>Study helpful books and digital publications.</u> </b>
                    With an understanding of what you need to work on, you can begin selecting materials to help you be
                    more successful. This may come in the form of books, online coursework or digital publications
                    <b>Books:</b>Reading books on things like coding or management styles can help you increase your knowledge
                                and provide confident, thorough answers in your interview.
                    <b>Online Coursework:</b> Reviewing online coursework can help with the practical application of technical skills.
                    <b>Digital Publications:</b> Online publications can help you expand your knowledge-base, but also keep you
                                                  aware of trends in technology that may be relevant to your interview.
            
            <b  style="color: rgb(5, 95, 5);"> 3. <u>Practice for the interview.</u></b>
                        Many technical jobs are based on mathematics. To prepare for the practical elements of a job interview,
                    like take-home work or in-person problem-solving, you can practice logical equation strings that make 
                    sense for the position. Thinking out loud can help during this process. Not only is it a good way to 
                    stay engaged while solving complex problems, but it's also important for interviewers to know your 
                    thought process. That being said, try thinking out loud while you solve practice problems to better 
                    prepare for your technical interview.
                        If you're going into a coding position, you should practice answering coding questions. Several online
                    resources offer coding interview questions and answers including Indeed Career Advice. You can also 
                    practice answering questions from experience using the STAR method of answering interview questions,
                    which asks you to consider sharing a challenging experience and your role in solving it, as well as 
                    the outcome.
                        While you're practicing questions for all sorts of scenarios, review the kinds of general interview 
                    questions about skills and behaviors that you're likely to have at an interview. These will be key to
                    securing your technical job, so you make sure you spend time on them.

            <b style="color: rgb(5, 95, 5);"> 4. <u>Be a conversationalist and prepare to ask questions. </u></b>
                         In addition to being knowledgeable and showing demonstrable skills, being able to communicate with people
                    professionally is important. Doing things like talking through your work, providing thorough, on-topic 
                    answers and arriving at your interview prepared to ask questions can make a big difference when it comes
                    to moving forward in the process.
                         To better prepare for the conversation, have a few questions you'd like to ask the interviewer ready. 
                    This will likely require additional research on your part. Take some time to review the company and job
                    description before the interview, and jot down any questions that arise. It's also customary for candidates
                    to hold their questions for the end of the interview, so consider that before jumping into your own 
                    pre-scripted questions.

            <b style="color: rgb(5, 95, 5);">  5. <u>Take the time you need.</u></b>
                         Whether answering take-home coding questions or using a whiteboard in real-time at your interview, take
                    the time you need to solve the problem and check your work. If you slow down and make sure not to rush, 
                    you're likely to have fewer errors.

     <b><h3 style="color: rgb(27, 6, 121);">------- HR Interview -------</h3></b>
              <b>Your Resume</b> is usually your chance at a first impression with a hiring manager, so of course, having 
            an excellent one is key. There are all the usual things, like your contact information, education and
            work history. But there are other elements that are very necessary for a good Resume when you're applying
            for a role in HR.

            <b>How to prepare for an HR interview</b>
            If you've got your meeting arranged, congrats! Here's how to prepare for an HR interview.

                 Research the company you're interviewing with. Take in as much information as you can about the 
            business, read their entire website, look at all their social media platforms, and look up the 
            latest news about them. You can't be too thorough here.Research the person who is interviewing 
            you. Look at their LinkedIn and understand their path to the company, as well as their past experience.
            Be prepared to ask them questions about their role and their time at the company.Carefully read the 
            job description and understand every point, as well as how your own skills fulfil all the requirements.
            If there is a gap, don't worry, just be prepared to explain and use some of your soft skills or other
            applicable experience to fill it. Review your Resume and be prepare to answer questions about it, as 
            well. From why you want to leave your current role or what you did and didn't enjoy about past roles,
            it's good to have a handle on your career progression. Prepare answers to any questions you think you
            might be asked. More on that in the next section.

        <b style="color: rgb(8, 130, 43);">     Examples of HR interview questions </b>
            Below are some examples of common HR interview questions you may encounter and sample answers you
            can use to guide your own.

        <b>     1. Sample question: Why are you interested in this position? </b>

            HR pros are likely trying to get you to reiterate your strengths and highlight your passion for both
            the company and the role. Talk about your past experiences and how they apply to this job, and link 
            what you're saying back to what they've said and to  the job description.

        <b>     Answer: </b>After working in learning and development for seven years, I truly appreciate the power of an HR
                            team to truly impact the whole organisation. As an HR manager, I would apply my ability to create
                            the best environment for my colleagues to thrive in and help them do their best to further 
                            organisational goals. I have done this in past roles, and I know I can apply my skills here, as well.

      <b>       2. Sample question: Tell me about yourself. </b>

            For this one, you need to give a compelling answer without rambling too much about personal things. 
            Doing a SWOT analysis is a good approach, analysing the sector, the company, and the job, finding 
            opportunities to market yourself.

        <b>     Answer: </b>I have been an HR manager for seven years, with experiences that include leading an HR team to
                            create the best possible environment for our colleagues. I know that your organisation has a
                            great retention rate, and it would be my personal mission to maintain that. In previous roles,
                            I helped increase my company's retention rate at a  steady in just my first year, and maintained
                            it throughout subsequent years. Essential here: Figure out what the company's HR goals are, and 
                            tailor your answer to them.

       <b>      3. Sample question: Tell me about a time in your past when you had to handle confidential information. </b>

            If you have had to handle private information in past roles, discuss that. If not, talk about a 
            time when you were privy to private information while helping a colleague. Focus on your ability
            to work with integrity and a respect for people's privacy.

       <b>      Answer: </b>In my past roles, I have always had to deal with my colleagues' private information. I understand
                            how detrimental it would be if I didn't take every precaution with that information, both for that
                            person and for the company. I only access this kind of information when I need it, I never share it
                            with unauthorised colleagues, and I keep it saved I a secure location.

       <b>      4. Sample question: Have you ever helped an employee deal with a personal problem that was affecting
             them at work? </b>

            You should have examples for this one if you have worked on HR teams in the past. If not, use other
            relevant examples from your past roles, or a more personal example.

        <b>     Answer: </b>I have, and I've found the most important thing here is to be empathetic, but also remain professional.
                            I listen carefully to understand the problem, and how it is impacting the person's day-to-day tasks.
                            I ask them how I can help alleviate some of that stress during their workday, and if their job is 
                            contributing to that stress in any way. Then, I work to make a plan with them to help manage that 
                            problem during work hours.

       <b>      5. Sample question: What do you believe the role of an HR department is, and how does it relate to
             the mission of a business? </b>

           Here, give a general answer that shows you understand HR, and how it connect to organisational goals,
           then provide specific examples that relate to the company.

        <b>     Answer: </b>Through my seven years working in HR, I've come to understand how HR can affect every aspect of a 
                            business. It plays a real role in growth, from recruitment to restructuring to business strategy. 
                            People are a company's most important resource, and having a solid HR department that protects and 
                            supports those people can only have a positive impact on the organisation.

      <b>       How to follow up after your HR interview </b>
                  As soon as possible following your interview, send a thank you note to the person who interviewed 
                you. Thank them for their time, tell them you enjoyed meeting them and learning more about the 
                company, and remind them that you're available to provide any further necessary information.
                  If in the unfortunate case that you aren't successful, be polite and gracious. You never know when
                they might be hiring again, and if they really liked you, they'll remember you the next time they're
                recruiting.
                  To be prepared for that occasion, ask the interviewer for specific feedback. Ask them if there are
                certain gaps in your Resume that a course could fill, or if they were looking for different experience 
                that you could work to gain in your current role.

        <b style="color: red;">              ----- Good luck! ----- </b>
