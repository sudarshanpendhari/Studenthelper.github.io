        <b>Group Discussion(GD)</b>  is a type of discussion that involves people sharing ideas or activities. People in the <br>
        group discussion are connected with one basic idea. Based on that idea, everyone in the group represents his/her perspective. <br><br>

       <b><u style="color: rgb(9, 0, 128);"> Rules of Group Discussion </u></b><br>
         
           There are some rules of a Group Discussion. The rules of Group Discussion are listed <br>
           below: <br><br>
        
      <b>  1) Prepare well for the topic. </b> <br>
            The quick trick is to note all the important points during the preparation time. Do not <br>
            write brief paragraphs. Try to write short points and explain them briefly in the group <br>
            discussion. <br><br>

       <b> 2) Be confident about your content </b><br>
            It would help if you always were confident about your content. If you are not confident,<br>
            you may hesitate while speaking, which will create a negative impression. <br><br>

      <b>  3) Participants Introduction </b><br>
            Most participants only focus on their content. You should be aware during the <br>
            introduction of all the participants in your group. To get attention, you can call out the <br>
            person's name when the discussion gets diverted. <br><br>

       <b> 4) Body Language </b> <br>
            Always take care of your body language. Do not focus only on the content. <br><br>

      <b>  5) Leadership </b> <br>
            Try to take the lead in the group if you are confident about the topic and the knowledge. <br><br>

      <b>  6) Avoid false starts or commitments </b> <br>
            Do not initiate the discussion if you are not sure about your content. Do not present any wrong information. <br><br>

      <b>  7) Follow your Domain </b> <br>
            Every company has its own culture. Prepare your content according to the company requirements.  <br>
            For example, industrial companies will focus more on technical talks, while marketing companies <br>
            seek the combination of creative and oriented content. <br><br>

       <b> 8) Do not fight </b> <br>
            In the Group Discussion, some candidates often get aggressive. Do not fight during the discussion. <br>
            Most of the companies require sensitive and polite candidates rather than aggressive ones. <br><br>
