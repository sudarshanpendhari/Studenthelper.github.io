      <b>1) Verbal Ability Test </b> 
       Verbal Aptitude test analyses the ability of the candidate to use written language and understand the concepts presented through words. This test can assess many different <br>
       abilities of a candidate, such as to spell words correctly, use proper grammar and vocabulary, understand word meanings, and/or interpret written information precisely.  <br>
       
      <b>2) Quantitative Aptitude Test</b> <br>
       Quantitative aptitude test or numerical aptitude test measures the ability of candidates to interpret, analyse and draw logical conclusions based on numerical data. There are <br>
       various types of numerical aptitude test questions from various categories like basic arithmetic, advanced mathematical knowledge, numerical logic, numerical reasoning and  <br>
       word problems.

      <b>3) Non-verbal Reasoning Test </b> <br>
       This test involves measuring the ability of the candidates to understand and analyse information presented visually and solve the problems logically. There are several types <br>
       of non-verbal reasoning aptitude test questions from different categories, including abstract reasoning, inductive reasoning, diagrammatic reasoning, spatial ability,  <br>
       non-verbal analogy and more. <br>
